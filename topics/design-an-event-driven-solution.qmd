# Design an Event-Driven solution
Azure Event Grid is a routing service connecting data sources with event handlers.

![Azure Event Grid](../images/azure-event-grid.png)

- Events sources include Azure resources or custom topics (you create).
- Event handlers react to an event.
- Useful for serverless applications and operations automation.
- Use *filters* to route and multicast events.
- Uses a pay-per-event pricing model.
