# What is Infrastructure as Code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of automating your infrastructure provisioning.

- The IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied.
- Solves the problem of environmental drift.
- Enables teams to test applications in production-like envvironments early.
- Where possible, uses declarative definition files.
