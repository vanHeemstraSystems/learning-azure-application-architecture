# Design an Event Hub messaging solution
Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service.

- Orders events by when they are received - by time offsets.
- Uses a pull model allowing multiple reads from consumers.
- Scaling is controlled by how many throughput units or processing units you purchase.
- Doesn't account for messages that aren't processed.
- Receiving IoT and real-time streaming data.
