Ephemeral means the communication might not be handled by any receiver if none is currently subscribing.\n\n\nMessage\n- Contains raw data, produced by one component, that will be consumed by another component.- Contains the data itself, not just a reference to that data.\nUsed where the distributed application requires a guarantee that the communication will be processed."
